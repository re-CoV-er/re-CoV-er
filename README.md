re-CoV-er: Infectiously Human
=============================

Beating Covid-19 takes drastic measures - we need all the physical distancing
we can get to avoid completely overwhelming our healthcare systems.

Even for those of us in the comparatively comfortable situation of being able
to do our jobs remotely, the outlook for the next couple of weeks/months is
somewhere between grim to terrifying.

But now imagine how things look for all those people who _**cannot**_ do their
job remotely: artists, teachers of things that cannot be done online (like
dance), small entrepreneurs whose business is crushed, etc.

Now, if we're all gonna end up under lockdown in one form or another, those of
us who can still work will continue to earn almost as usual, while we won't be
spending much at all. Therefore...

The Idea
========

The idea is to provide a digital platform for people who *can* earn their
living from home to pledge a portion of their income to those who cannot,
pooled across self-governing communities, while those who *cannot* work may
(optionally!) give back whatever services they are able to.

**These are unprecedented times in all of our lifetimes - let's take
unprecedented action.**
