re-CoV-er: Infectiously Human
=============================

Beating Covid-19 takes drastic measures - we need all the social distancing we
can get to avoid completely overwhelming our healthcare systems.

Even for those of us in the comparatively comfortable situation of being able
to do our jobs remotely, the outlook for the next couple of weeks/months is
somewhere between grim to terrifying.

But now imagine how things look for all those people who CANNOT do their job
remotely: artists, teachers of things that cannot be done online (like dance),
small entrepreneurs whose business is crushed.

Now, if we're all gonna end up under lockdown in one form or another, those of
us who can still work will continue to earn almost as usual, while we won't be
spending much at all. Therefore...

unprecedented action.**
